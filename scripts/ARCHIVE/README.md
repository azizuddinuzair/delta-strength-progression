# 🔧 Development Scripts Archive

This directory contains historical development and debugging scripts used during model development and system analysis. They are preserved for reference but are not part of the active system.

## Purpose

These scripts were used for:
- Model analysis and diagnostics
- Data exploration
- Database inspection
- Training pipeline debugging
- Pattern analysis

## Usage

These scripts are for **development and debugging only**. They may reference:
- Outdated module structures
- Specific test data
- Temporary analysis patterns
- Non-production workflows

## Note

For production use, always use:
- `../../run_app.py` – Interactive CLI application
- `../../QUICKSTART.py` – System setup and initialization

For model training or retraining, use the CLI commands documented in `../../DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`.

## Scripts

All .py files in this directory are archived development utilities. Refer to git history or `../../docs/ARCHIVE/` for context on specific scripts if needed.
